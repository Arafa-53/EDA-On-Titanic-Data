# Titanic EDA

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset
## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Understand key factors affecting passenger survival.
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Handled missing values.  
  - Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., `Cabin` with excessive nulls).  
  - Converted and extracted useful features from date/time where applicable.
- **Exploration:**  
  - Distribution of survival across **gender**, **passenger class**, and **age**.  
  - Correlation heatmap to identify strong relationships between features.  
  - Outlier detection and removal where necessary.
- **Visualization:**  
  - Bar plots, histograms, and boxplots for categorical and numerical variables.  
  - Survival comparison plots for gender, class, and embarkation port.  

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **First-class passengers** had higher survival chances.
- Younger passengers generally had better survival rates.
- Embarkation port showed variation in survival rates.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn
